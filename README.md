# Breadth First Search for the 15 Puzzle problem



* The program implements **breadth first search** in order to find the sequence of moves that will solve the **15 puzzle problem**.

* The following link details what is a 15 puzzle problem: [15 puzzle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)
* some of the possible unsolved puzzle states:
* ![Unsolved puzzle 1](https://github.com/yashchitre03/Breadth-First-Search/blob/master/15puzzlebef.jpeg)
* ![Unsolved puzzle 2](https://github.com/yashchitre03/Breadth-First-Search/blob/master/15puzzleaft.jpeg)
* It uses dictionaries in python with each move of a tile represented in terms of a function.
* Finally, it outputs the moves to reach the final state as well as the number of nodes expanded in the process (as it is a breadth first search).
* The program also notes down the time consumed and memory usage so that we can compare it with other approaches to solve the same problem.
